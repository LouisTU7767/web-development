                    <p>There are different types of secrets. 
                    She had held onto plenty of them during her life, 
                    but this one was different. She found herself 
                    holding onto the worst type. It was the type of 
                    secret that could gnaw away at your insides if 
                    you didn't tell someone about it, but it could 
                    end up getting you killed if you did.</p>

                    <p>It was just a burger. 
                    Why couldn't she understand that? 
                    She knew he'd completely changed his life 
                    around her eating habits, so why couldn't she 
                    give him a break this one time? She wasn't even 
                    supposed to have found out. Yes, he had 
                    promised her and yes, he had broken that 
                    promise, but still in his mind, all it had been 
                    was just a burger.</p>

                    <p>It was a rat's nest. 
                    Not a literal one, 
                    but that is what her hair seemed to resemble 
                    every morning when she got up. It was going to 
                    take at least an hour to get it under control 
                    and she was sick and tired of it. She peered 
                    into the mirror and wondered if it was worth 
                    it. It wasn't. She opened the drawer and picked 
                    up the hair clippers.</p>
