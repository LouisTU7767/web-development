                <h5>1.1 Proof by contradiction</h5>
                <p>A contradiction is a disagreement between two statements, which means that both cannot be true. Proof by contradiction is a powerful technique.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>To prove a statement by contradiction you start by assuming it is not true. You then use logical steps to show that this assumption leads to something impossible (either a contradiction of the assumption, or a contradiction of a fact you know to be true). You can conclude that your assumption was incorrect, and the original statement was true.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A rational number can be written as \( \frac{a}{b} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are integers.</p></li>
                    <li><p>An irrational number cannot be expressed in the form \( \frac{a}{b} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are integers.</p></li>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>A single fraction with two distinct linear factors in the denominator can be split into two separate fractions with linear denominators. This is called splitting it into partial fractions.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The method of partial fractions can also be used when there are more than two distinct linear factors in the denominator.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <h5>2.2 Repeated factors</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>A single fraction with a repeated linear factor in the denominator can be split into two or more separate fractions.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <h5>2.3 Improper fractions</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>An improper fraction is one that is top heavy, where the power of the numerator is equal to or greater than the power of the denominator. An improper fraction can be split into partial fractions.</p></li>

                <h5>3.1 Parametric equations</h5>
                <p>You can write the \( x \)- and \( y \)-coordinates of each point on a curve as functions of a third variable. This variable is called a parameter and is often represented by the letter \( t \).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>A curve can be defined using parametric equations \( x = p(t) \) and \( y = q(t) \). Each value of the parameter, \( t \), defines a point on the curve with coordinates \( (p(t), q(t)) \).</p></li>
                    <li><p>You can convert between parametric equations and Cartesian equations by using substitution to eliminate the parameter.</p></li>
                    <li><p>For parametric equations \( x = p(t) \) and \( y = q(t) \) with Cartesian equation \( y = f(x) \): </p></li>

            <h4>Chapter 4 Binomial expansion</h4>
                <h5>4.1 Expanding \( \boldsymbol{(1 + x)^{n}} \)</h5>
                <p>If \( n \) is a natural number you can find the binomial expansion for \( (a + b x)^{n} \) using the formula: \( (a + b)^{n} = a^{n} + {n \choose 1} a^{n - 1} b + {n \choose 2} a^{n - 2} b^{2} + ... + {n \choose r} a^{n - r} b^{r} + ... + b^{n}, \)\( \ (n \in \mathbb{N}) \)</p>
                <p>If \( n \) is a fraction or a negative number you need to use a different version of the binomial expansion.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>This form of the binomial expansion can be applied to negative or fractional values of \( n \) to obtain an infinite series.</p></li>
                    <p>\( (1 + x)^{n} = 1 + n x + \frac{n (n - 1)}{2!} x^{2} + \frac{n (n - 1) (n - 2)}{3!} x^{3} + ... \)\( + (\frac{n (n - 1) ... (n - r + 1)}{r!}) x^{r} + ... \)</p>
                    <li><p>The expansion is valid when \( |x| < 1 \), \( n \in \mathbb{R} \)</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>When \( n \) is not a natural number, none of the factors in the expression \( n (n - 1) ... (n - r + 1) \) are equal to zero. This means that this version of the binomial expansion produces an infinite number of terms.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The expansion of \( (1 + b x)^{n} \), where \( n \) is negative or a fraction, is valid for \( |b x| < 1 \), or \( |x| < \frac{1}{|b|} \)</p></li>
                </ul>

                <h5>4.2 Expanding \( \boldsymbol{(a + b x)^{n}} \)</h5>
                <p>The binomial expansion of \( (1 + x)^{n} \) can be used to expand \( (a + b x)^{n} \) for any constants \( a \) and \( b \).</p>
                <p>You need to take a factor of \( a^{n} \) out of the expression: \( (a + b x)^{n} = (a(1 + \frac{b}{a} x))^{n} = a^{n} (1 + \frac{b}{a} x)^{n} \)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The expansion of \( (a + b x)^{n} \), where \( n \) is negative or a fraction, is valid for \( |\frac{b}{a} x| < 1 \) or \( x < |\frac{a}{b}| \)</p></li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Chapter 5 Differentiation</h4>
                <h5>5.1 Parametric differentiation</h5>
                <p>When functions are defined parametrically, you can find the gradient at a given point without converting into Cartesian form. You can use a variation of the chain rule: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>If \( x \) and \( y \) are given as functions of a parameter, \( t \): \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}} \)</p></li>
                </ul>

                <h5>5.2 Implicit differentiation</h5>
                <p>Some equations are difficult to rearrange into the form \( y = f(x) \) or \( x = f(y) \). You can sometimes differentiate these equations implicitly without rearranging them.</p>
                <p>In general, from the chain rule: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>\( \frac{d}{dx} (f(y)) = f'(y) \frac{dy}{dx} \)</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The following two specific results are useful for implicit differentiation: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>\( \frac{d}{dx} (y^{n}) = n y^{n - 1} \frac{dy}{dx} \)</p></li>
                    <li><p>\( \frac{d}{dx} (x y) = x \frac{dy}{dx} +  y \)</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you differentiate implicit equations your expressions for \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) will usually be given in terms of both \( x \) and \( y \).</p>

                <h5>5.3 Rates of change</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>You can use the chain rule to connect rates of change in situations involving more than two variables.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>An equation that involves a rate of change is called a differential equation.</p>

            <h4>Chapter 6 Integration</h4>
                <h5>6.1 Finding the area under a curve defined parametrically</h5>
                <p>You already know how to find the area under a curve using integration. We are now going to extend this idea by looking at the area under a curve that is defined by a set of parametric equations.</p>
                <p>If we consider the curve \( C \) defined by \( x = f(t) \), \( y = g(t) \) for \( a \leq t \leq b \), and start with the formula for the area under a curve, then we have \( A = \int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} y\ dx \). The curve we have does not quite fit this formula. We can see that \( y \) can be replaced by \( g(t) \), but how do we replace the \( dx \)? Since we know \( x = f(t) \), it is reasonable to state that \( \frac{dx}{dt} = f'(t) \), and so \( dx = f'(t)\ dt \)</p>
                <p>Now we can write \( A = \int_{t = a}^{t = b} g(t) f'(t)\ dt \). This is the formula for the area under a parametric curve.</p>

                <h5>6.2 Volumes of revolution around the \( x \)-axis</h5>
                <p>You have used integration to find the area of a region \( R \) bounded by a curve, the \( x \)-axis and two vertical lines.</p>
                <p>The area between a positive curve, the \( x \)-axis and the line \( x = a \) and \( x = b \) is given by \( \text{Area} = \int_{a}^{b} y\ dx \) where \( y = f(x) \) is the equation of the curve.</p>
                <p>You can derive this formula by considering the sum of an infinite number of small strips of width \( \delta x \). Each of these strips has a height of \( y \), so the area of each strip is \( \delta A = y \delta x \)</p>
                <p>The total area is approximately the sum of these strips, or \( \sum y \delta x \)</p>
                <p>The exact area is the limit of this sum as \( \delta x \to 0 \) which is written as \( \int y\ dx \).</p>
                <p>You can use a similar technique to find the volume of an object created by rotating a curve around a coordinate axis. If each of these strips is rotated through \( 2 \pi \) radians (or \( 360^{\circ} \)) about the \( x \)-axis, it will form a shape that is approximately cylindrical. The volume of each cylinder will be \( \pi y^{2} \delta x \) since it will have radius \( y \) and height \( \delta x \).</p>
                <p>So the volume of the solid will be approximately equal to the sum of the volumes of each cylinder, or \( \sum \pi y^{2} \delta x \). The exact volume is the limit of this sum as \( \delta x \to 0 \), or \( \pi \int y^{2}\ dx \)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The volume of revolution formed when \( y = f(x) \) is rotated through \( 2 \pi \) radians about the \( x \)-axis between \( x = a \) and \( x = b \) is given by: \( \text{Volume}= \pi \int_{a}^{b} y^{2}\ dx \)</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>If a function is given in parametric form, such as \( x = f(t) \), \( y = g(t) \) for \( a \leq t \leq b \), in order to determine the volume you must start from the standard formula.</p>
                <p>So, using \( V = \pi \int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} y^{2}\ dx \), we first notice that there is no reference to our parameter, the integral is purely in terms of \( x \).</p>
                <p>If we consider \( \frac{dx}{dt} = f'(t) \), this can be written as \( dx = f'(t)\ dt \).</p>
                <p>Substituting all of this into our volume formula gives \( V = \pi \int_{a}^{b} (g(t))^{2} f'(t)\ dt \) that is an integral purely in terms of \( t \) which can now be evaluated.</p>

                <h5>6.3 Integration by substitution</h5>
                <p>Sometimes you can simplify an integral by changing the variable. The process is similar to using the chain rule in differentiation and is called integration by substitution.</p>

                <h5>6.4 Integration by parts</h5>
                <p>You can rearrange the product rule for differentiation: </p>
                <p>
                    \( \begin{align} 
                        \frac{d}{dx} (u v) & = u \frac{dv}{dx} + v \frac{du}{dx} \\
                        u \frac{dv}{dx} & = \frac{d}{dx} (u v) - v \frac{du}{dx} \\
                        \int u \frac{dv}{dx}\ dx & = \int \frac{d}{dx} (u v)\ dx - \int v \frac{du}{dx}\ dx
                    \end{align} \)
                </p>
                <p>Differentiating a function and then integrating it leaves the original function unchanged. So, \( \int \frac{d}{dx} (u v) dx = u v \)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>This method is called integration by parts. \( \int u \frac{dv}{dx}\ dx = u v - \int v \frac{du}{dx}\ dx \)</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>To use integration by parts you need to write the function you are integrating in the form \( u \frac{dv}{dx} \)</p>
                <p>You will have to choose what to set as \( u \) and what to set as \( \frac{dv}{dx} \)</p>

                <h5>6.5 Partial fractions</h5>
                <p>Partial fractions can be used to integrate algebraic fractions.</p>
                <p>Using partial fractions enables an expression that looks hard to integrate to be transformed into two or more expressions that are easier to integrate.</p>
                <p>When the degree of the polynomial in the numerator is greater than or equal to the degree of the denominator, it is necessary to first divide the numerator by the denominator.</p>

                <h5>6.6 Solving differential equations</h5>
                <p>Integration can be used to solve differential equations. In this chapter you will solve first order differential equations by separating the variables.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>When \( \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x) g(y) \) you can write \( \int \frac{1}{g(y)}\ dy = \int f(x)\ dx \)</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The solution to a differential equation will be a function. When you integrate to solve a differential equation you still need to include a constant of integration. This gives the general solution to the differential equation. It represents a family of solutions, all with different constants. Each of these solutions satisfies the original differential equation.</p>
